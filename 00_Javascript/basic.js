// Different way of declaring variable in javascript

// old way of declaring variable in javascript
var score = 420
// console.log("Var score = "+score);

// In this present time we do not use var to define variable in javascript
// var is not a good way to declare variable in javascript because it has different types of security flaws.

// New way of declaring variable in javascript
// we cannot re-assign value in const variable because of its constant behavior.
// If we do it if send error like "Assignment to constant variable"

const userName = "@Sushil0112"
// userName = "Munna"
// console.log(userName);


// We can easily re-assign new value in let variable in javascript as given below example
let phoneNumber = 9766423737
phoneNumber = 9335399356
// console.log(phoneNumber)
